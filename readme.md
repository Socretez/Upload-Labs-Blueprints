# Upload Labs Schematics

A schematic database for **Upload Labs**, now focused on **version 2.1.x** builds and end-game progression.

## Repository Layout

- `2.1/` - Active Schematics and notes for version 2.1.
  - 2.1/Examples - Screenshots
- `Archive/` - Legacy reference materials and older schematic structure.

## 2.1 Schematic Index

1. `2.1/1. The Works.txt`
   - Full integrated layout that links every 2.1 node group into one coordinated factory.
2. `2.1/2. Hardware.txt`
   - Core 5:2:2 Network/CPU/GPU generation block with early-run seller/tether toggle flow.
3. `2.1/3. Main Production.txt`
   - Primary money and infection pipeline with main and import lines feeding the imprinter path.
4. `2.1/4. Virus.txt`
   - Lightweight virus production lane tuned to supply imprinting at a fixed low-cost ratio.
5. `2.1/5. AGI.txt`
   - Self-contained AGI boost engine that distributes AI power to key production groups.
6. `2.1/6. Research.txt`
   - Flexible research farm with selectable decomp paths and simple toggles for file-type scaling.
7. `2.1/7. Hacking.txt`
   - Portal-ready hacking setup focused on fast early breaches and infection progression.
8. `2.1/8. Coding.txt`
   - Controlled application/optimization point builder with ratio toggles for 8/41 targets.
9. `2.1/9. Mini-Factory.txt`
   - Dual-mode factory cash module for early import boost or stabilized late-run machine output.

## Version Focus

- **Version Target:** Upload Labs 2.1.x
  - Current Version: 2.1.10

## Strategy Shift: 2.0 to 2.1

### 2.0 (Archived)

The old approach centered around a large **All-in-One production block** that handled most transformations in one place.

### 2.1 (Current)

The new approach shifts to a **modular import pipeline**:

1. Build efficient upstream lanes for **virus and modifier imports**.
2. Feed those imports into dedicated processing steps.
3. **Imprint** into a main production line instead of forcing every process into one giant block.
4. Route final outputs toward sustained **Portal** and **Advanced Research** loops.

This architecture is easier to tune, scales better for end-game throughput, and reduces the clocking/rebalancing pain of monolithic All-in-One designs.

## How to Use Schematics

This repo is intended to be used as a **respository** for schematic imports.

1. Open the repository page in your browser.
2. Open the `2.1` schematic `.txt` file you want to use.
3. Copy the full text contents.
4. In Upload Labs, use the in-game import tool and paste.

## Migration Notes

- Treat `Archive/` as reference only.
- Build all new or updated production lines under `2.1/`.
- Prioritize modular virus/modifier intake + imprint stages over reviving old All-in-One blocks.

## WIP

- [ ] Optimize import lines to `Main Production:AGI`.
